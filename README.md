# Refactoring

Ignore bonus.md for now -- that's a bonus release for when/if you've finished the core challenges.

In this challenge, you'll need to use parent class(es), inheritance relationship(s), and/or modules to clean up repetition in code.

Your tests currently pass. When you're finished with any given improvement to the code, they should still pass. Do not change the tests.

# Release 1

What do the Teacher and ApprenticeTeacher classes have in common? DRY it up.

Make sure the tests still pass.
